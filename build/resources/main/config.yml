## Should the indicator be shown to everyone(true) or just the player who dealt the damage(false)
ShowToDamagerOnly: true

## The format for showing the damage
# Read about decimal formats to learn how to configure the indicator format.
# https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/text/DecimalFormat.html

# Hex colours are supported using the legacy format (e.g. &x&F&F&F&F&F&F to represent white), but may also be defined
# using a smaller version unique to the damage indicator plugin (e.g. &#FFFFFF to represent white). Note that the usage
# of 0's in the hex code would mess with the decimal formatting, hence they should be escaped using single quotes, such
# as this:
# IndicatorFormat: "'&#FFC300'-0.#&4❤"

# using Hex colours is optional. The legacy minecraft colour codes are still supported.
IndicatorFormat: "&7-0.#&4❤"
CriticalIndicatorFormat: "&c-0.#&4❤"

## For how long an indicator should be shown. (Use seconds)
IndicatorTime: 1.5
